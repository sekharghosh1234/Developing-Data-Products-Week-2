## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=7.68465, lat=45.0432, popup="Salsa Rossa - Really good pizza in Turin")
my_map 
```
